lockers
=======

This is a programmatic solution to my daughter's math homework problem:

There are 100 lockers, all closed.
Person #1 opens every locker.
Person #2 flips (opens if closed, closes if open) every other locker
Person #3 flips every 3rd locker
...
Person #n flips every nth locker

After person #100 finishes, which lockers are open?

You'll find the solution very curious.

We've taken 2 approaches to it so far. One brute force, and a second one that tests a theory.
